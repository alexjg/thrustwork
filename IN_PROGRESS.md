# Implementation Progress Tracker

This document tracks the step-by-step implementation of features. It's organized into discrete chunks of work that are each small enough to review independently. When working on this codebase with an LLM, use this document to understand what has been completed and what needs to be done next.

The overall design we are working on is described in DESIGN.md and the separate phases of development are described in IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md. This document always tracks the development of one phase.

**How to use this document:**
- Each task block represents a reviewable unit of work
- **IMPORTANT: Stop for review after completing each task block before proceeding to the next**
- Mark tasks as [x] when completed
- Add notes about deviations or important decisions under each section
- When resuming work, scan for the first uncomplected task

**General Instructions**
- Read DESIGN.md and IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md for context

**Technical Decisions**
- Using `autosurgeon` crate for mapping Rust structs to Automerge documents
  - Provides `Reconcile` (write) and `Hydrate` (read) derive macros
  - Use `#[autosurgeon(rename = "...")]` for field renaming (e.g., `@patchwork`, `mimeType`)
  - With samod: use `doc.transact(|txn| reconcile(txn, &value))` since samod's
    `with_document` provides `&mut Automerge`, but `reconcile` needs `Transactable`
  - For reading: `hydrate(&doc)` works directly on `Automerge` (no transaction needed)

**Pushwork Schema Compatibility Notes** (discovered during Phase 2):
- Metadata fields (`@patchwork.type`, `name`, `extension`, `mimeType`, directory entry
  fields) must be `autosurgeon::Text` (collaborative text objects)
- File `content` must be `String` (scalar string = ImmutableString in pushwork)
- `permissions` is stored as `i64` (JavaScript number -> Automerge Int)
- `lastSyncAt` may be absent, use `#[autosurgeon(missing = "Default::default")]`
